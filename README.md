# TeXPy
Execute single line latex like wolfram would. Also supports limited plaintext operations (see [this wolfram alpha guide](https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/Integrals.html))

What you can do:
+ Compute integrals
+ Compute non-symbolic equation

TODO:
+ Derivations
+ Symbolic integral bounds
+ Non-integer integral bounds
+ ~~Fix implicit multiplications (3x or xy)~~
+ ~~Nested Integrals~~
+ ~~Fractions~~
